# This file contains some tweaks that are necessary for the nova-compute
# charm in order to run with privileges and configuration other than what
# Juju can provide by default in a Kubernetes operator charm.

Pod:
  spec:
    # Using the hostNetwork allows the pod to see which network interface
    # cards are attached to the host. This is required in order to wire the
    # OVN/OVS services into the host networking.
    hostNetwork: True

    # Using the hostPID allows for the virtual machines that are launched to
    # be persisted across container restarts.
    hostPID: True

    # Since nova-compute is using hostNetwork, explicitly set the dnsPolicy
    # to ClusterFirstWithHostNet in order to enable cluster dns resolution
    # and allow host networking.
    dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
