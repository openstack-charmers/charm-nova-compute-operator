summary: OpenStack Nova compute service
maintainer: OpenStack Charmers <openstack-charmers@lists.ubuntu.com>
description: |
  OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller. In
  addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon
  EC2 API.
  
  This charm provides the Nova Compute hypervisor service and should be deployed
  directly to physical servers.
